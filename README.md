A new Flutter project.

"Registration and Login Pages"
Student: Arislanbek Kalbaev
ID: 220081

In this project's scope, my responsibilities included developing user interface for registration and login pages for users.

In Registration page, a user can enter:
1) First name (string)
2) Last name (string)
3) Passport (two characters, 7 integers format)
4) Date of Birth (in dd:mm:yyyy)
5) email account (string)
4) password

Validation: all data fields are mandatory to enter and a user cannot proceed further without entering them. Otherwise, alert/notification in standard red color is the output in UI.

In Login page, a user can enter his following login credentials after registering in the app:
1) Email
2) Passport

Validation: all data fields are mandatory to enter and a user cannot proceed further without entering them. Otherwise, alert/notification in standard red color is the output in UI.

Widgets used:
- Input fields
- Buttons
- Labels
- Layout
- Validation

From registration page he can move to login page and vice versa. After a user passes either of the screens successfully, he is transferred to Dashboard page.
